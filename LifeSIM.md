An interactive life simulation web game where users manage their daily routine and key decisions through an intuitive system. There is no avatar for the player, but actions and decisions are reflected in game statistics and results. The game includes:

- **Work:** 💼 Earn money to cover your needs and achieve your goals.
- **Bank:** 🏦 Manage your finances, save, pay debts or apply for loans.
- **Home:** 🏠 Manage your personal well-being with options such as eating 🍽️, cooking 🍳, sleeping 🛌, bathing 🚿, dressing 👗, playing 🎮 or cleaning 🧹.
- **Grocery:** 🛒 Buy food and other essentials, make payments 💳 and organize your resources in the fridge 🧊.
- **Social:** 🌍 Go out and have fun 🎉, attend events 🎭 or meet people 🤝, where the "others" will have personalized avatars.
